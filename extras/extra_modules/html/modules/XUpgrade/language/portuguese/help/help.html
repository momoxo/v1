<h4>Management</h4>
<h5>How to select the theme</h5>
<p>
<a href='<{$smarty.const.XOOPS_URL}>/base/admin/index.php?action=ThemeList'>'Theme management'</a> is good for you. Or, you may select it in the preference.
</p>

<h5>How to install module</h5>
<p>
The module management in Cube Legacy lists installed modules only.
To install new modules, you have to visit the <a href='<{$smarty.const.XOOPS_MODULE_URL}>/base/admin/index.php?action=InstallList'>'Install module'</a>.
</p>

<h5>How to switch the visible flag of blocks</h5>
<p>
The concept of blocks is one of the most changed features from XOOPS2 JP.
At first, you have to know that blocks have gotten 'Install' and 'Uninstall'.
When you install new modules, new blocks of the module are listed in the uninstalled block list.
</p>

<ul>
 <li>If you want to turn a block on, you have to visit <a href='<{$smarty.const.XOOPS_MODULE_URL}>/base/admin/index.php?action=BlockInstallList'>'Install block'</a>.
 <li>If you want to turn a block off, you have to uninstall it in <a href='<{$smarty.const.XOOPS_MODULE_URL}>/base/admin/index.php?action=BlockList'>'block management'</a>.
</ul>
<p>
 Also, the custom block has the concept of install.
 To create your custom block, click the <a href='<{$smarty.const.XOOPS_MODULE_URL}>/base/admin/index.php?action=CustomBlockEdit'>'Add Custom Block'</a> link in <a href='<{$smarty.const.XOOPS_MODULE_URL}>/base/admin/index.php?action=BlockInstallList'>'Install block'</a>.
</p>

<p>
 Blocks are deleted if you uninstall them. You can install them again anytime.
 To delete your custom block, you need to make it uninstalled once.
 Next, delete it in <a href='<{$smarty.const.XOOPS_MODULE_URL}>/base/admin/index.php?action=BlockInstallList'>'Install block'</a>. Blocks of the module are deleted when you uninstall the module.
</p>

<h5>How to send mail or PM to many users</h5>
<p>
That's changed all. And, that became more useful. (Developes think so. How do you think?)
</p>

<p>
 Well, you can send mail in <a href='<{$smarty.const.XOOPS_MODULE_URL}>/user/admin/index.php?action=MailjobList'>'Mailjob management'</a>.
 The mailjob is new concept in Cube Legacy.
 A mailjob has the mail body and the send list.
 At first, you have to make the send list by the <a href='<{$smarty.const.XOOPS_MODULE_URL}>/user/admin/index.php?action=UserSearch'>'Search users'</a>.
</p>

<ol>
 <li><a href='<{$smarty.const.XOOPS_MODULE_URL}>/user/admin/index.php?action=UserSearch'>Search users</a> to list users which you want to send mail to.
 <li>If you get the result you hope, click the 'Send mail by this condition' link, which is on the top of the table.
 <li>Write the subject and the body, and select Mail or PM.
 <li>After you finish it, the mailjob item is created and listed in the <a href='<{$smarty.const.XOOPS_MODULE_URL}>/user/admin/index.php?action=MailjobList'>'Mailjob management'</a>.
 <li>Click a name of the mailjob to send mails. Of course, you can keep the mailjob un-send.
