** NEVER UPLOAD all archive's files to your server!! **

Basically, the archive includes all files whether a file has been updated.
Therefore, if you upload all archive's files to your server, your server will
be written by archive's default state.

At the beginning, remove the following directory & file from the archive.

- /install
- /mainfile.php

Next, upload all files to your server.

Lastly, in the module management of Legacy's control panels, update all modules
which show red-color update icons.
